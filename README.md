# qmk-config-corne
This repository contains the QMK configuration for my wireless Corne 4.1 (CRKBD) 5-column split keyboard, running custom firmware built using QMK. The layout is based on Colemak, inspired by the principles of Miryoku â€” minimal finger travel, home-row mods, and layered functionality.
